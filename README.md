## SDL-Multi-channel-Music-Player

This code snippet provides a utility function to play two synced Mix_Chunk tracks at the same time with the ability to fade in between both, as well as fading in another two tracks that will play synced (while fading out the previous tracks). It can be integrated into any project that requires multiple channels of music playing with SDL_Mixer.

## Integration

To integrate the multi-channel music player into your project follow these steps:
1. Copy the project files into your project's utility folder.
2. Import the function where needed.
